# 🌟 Advanced React To-Do App
Welcome to the **Advanced React To-Do App**! 🎉 This is a responsive, feature-rich to-do application built with modern web technologies. It allows users to manage tasks with priorities, integrates user authentication, and is designed to be scalable and user-friendly.

🌟 Why This Project Stands Out
Dynamic Weather: Fetches weather data based on the user's location, making it more personalized.
Secure Authentication: Uses Firebase for secure user management.
Modern Tech Stack: Built with React, Redux, and Firebase for a robust and scalable app.
User-Friendly: Clean UI with responsive design for a seamless experience.

## 🚀 Features

- **Task Management** 🖥️
  - Add, delete, and prioritize tasks (High, Medium, Low).
  - Tasks are stored in Firebase Firestore for persistence and user-specific access.
- **User Authentication** 🔒
  - Secure login/logout using Firebase Authentication.
  - Tasks are protected and visible only to the logged-in user.
- **Weather Integration** 🌍
  - Planned integration with OpenWeatherMap API (currently disabled due to activation delay; displays a placeholder error).
- **Responsive Design** 📱💻
  - Fully responsive layout using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and Bootstrap, ensuring a great experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Error Handling** ⚠️
  - Graceful handling of API and authentication errors with user-friendly messages.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Redux, Bootstrap
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with async actions
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication & Firestore)
- **API**: OpenWeatherMap API (temporarily disabled)
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## 📥 Setup Instructions

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/shahin-314/todo-app.git
   cd todo-app
2. Install Dependencies:
   npm install
3. Configure Firebase:
   Set up a Firebase project at console.firebase.google.com.
   Enable Email/Password Authentication and Firestore Database.
   Replace the config in src/firebase.js with your Firebase project config.
4. Run the App:
   npm start
The app will launch at http://localhost:3000.

#📝 Notes:

  The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on the user's location. If        location access is denied, it defaults to London's weather.
  Firebase Authentication and Firestore ensure secure and user-specific task management.
  The app is fully responsive and works across all devices.
